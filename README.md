Hi World!

Palak here. I like building apps. 
Exploring new coding ways and learning simple approach for application development. From UI design and View creation to easy data access in MySQL/MongoDB or Coredata for iOS/android applications.

I love travelling and exploring places, hiking and camping. I even blog about them, making customized itineraries with various suggestions for various food options, accommodation and things to do. 

Here, I am creating a series of repositories, some with different fundamentals of Swift and some with apps on Android. 

#### ANDROID
I am working on NodeJS, Express, AngularJS, Backbone JS, native JavaScript, MongoDB/MySQL, HTML5/CSS3 withPlay, Ionic and Cordova frameworks. I will be uploading my own apps and other challenges on the go.

#### SWIFT
From basics to intermediate and eventually expert level. Most of the coding available in these repositories is compatible with Swift 3.0. Few are till 2.2 which will be updated soon.

So feel free to comment, post changes or suggest me to incorporate things in my various folders. All folders are public so anyone can access them on the go. 

Happy Learning!!  :smiley:
