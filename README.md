# hello-world

Hi World!

PJln here. I like Swift and ABAP. 
Exploring new coding ways and learning simple approach for UI design and View creation for iOS applications.

I love travelling to different places, hiking and camping. 

I am creating a series of repositories, all with different fundamentals of Swift. From basics to intermediate and eventually expert level. Most of the coding available in these repositories is compatible with Swift 3.0. Few are till 2.2 which will be updated soon.

Feel free to comment, post changes or suggest me to incorporate things in my various folders. All folders are public so anyone can access them on the go. 

Happy Learning!!  :smiley:
