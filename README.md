# hello-world

Hi World!

Palak here. I like building apps. 
Exploring new coding ways and learning simple approach for UI design and View creation for iOS/android applications.

I love travelling and exploring placed, hiking and camping. I even blog about them, making customized iteniaries with various suggestions for saty,food and things to do. 

Here, I am creating a series of repositories, some with different fundamentals of Swift and Android Apps. From basics to intermediate and eventually expert level. Most of the coding available in these repositories is compatible with Swift 3.0. Few are till 2.2 which will be updated soon.

I am working on NodeJS, Express, AngularJS, Backbone JS, native JavaScript, MongoDB/MySQL, HTML5/CSS3 withPlay,Ionic and Cordova frameworks. I will be uploading my own apps and other challenges on the go.

SO feel free to comment, post changes or suggest me to incorporate things in my various folders. All folders are public so anyone can access them on the go. 

Happy Learning!!  :smiley:
